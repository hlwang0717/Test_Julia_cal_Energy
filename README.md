# Test_Julia_cal_Energy

This is a test code to calculate granular system's potential energy. The contact model is presented in Hertz.jl and Fast_Hertz.jl. We can compare the efficiency of this Julia code with the Matlab code in the Matlab test folder.

## How to use it
To run this test code, just include the "test_cal_energy.jl" file and "test1.jl" file in Juliav6 session. It will print two times to the screen, the first is unoptimised result, and the second is the fast version's result.

## Note
The code doesn't calculate the forces
